# Day 8 - Movie theatre

> Written in Kotlin

This is a size combinatorial algorithm which takes in an input of nodes, and we need to calculate
the maximum area between any two nodes. The puzzle input is a list of 2D co-ordinates which
represent these node locations.

We can say the following about the input files:
* They contain 1 to many lines
* Each line consists of `^[0-9]+,[0-9]+$` where the first number is the X coordinate, and the
  second is the Y coordinate

For example, given the puzzle input of:

```text
7,1
11,1
11,7
9,7
9,5
2,5
2,3
7,3
```

We can represent the grid as follows, where the nodes are represented with `#`.

```text
..............
.......#...#..
..............
..#....#......
..............
..#......#....
..............
.........#.#..
..............
```

We are looking for the largest area between two points in this grid, which, in this case, is
between `2,5`, and `11,1`.

```text
..............
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..............
.........#.#..
..............
```

This grid has a maximum area of `50`.

## Part two

Part two includes a restriction where the discovered rectangle from the first part must be within
the path generated by the input. Namely, if we now consider that the following is the path generated
from the input:

```text
..............
.......#XXX#..
.......X...X..
..#XXXX#...X..
..X........X..
..#XXXXXX#.X..
.........X.X..
.........#X#..
..............
```

Then the puzzle space which we can form a rectangle from is now:

```text
..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..#XXXX#XXXX..
..XXXXXXXXXX..
..#XXXXXX#XX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............
```

This means that the largest rectangle between two input nodes we can now make is between `9,5` and
`2,3`, resulting in a final score of `24`:

```text
..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............
```

## This script

This script uses Kotlin and requires compilation before it can be run:

```shell
mvn clean package
java -jar <program> input.txt <mode>
```

* To enable part one, use `unlimited` as the mode.
* To enable part two, use `limit` as the mode.

To enable debug logging, please provide the additional option of `-Dlog.level=debug`, i.e.:

```shell
java -Dlog.level=debug -jar <program> input.txt
```

A test package has been provided which can be run with:

```shell
mvn clean test
```
